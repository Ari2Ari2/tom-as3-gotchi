Welcome to my first tutorial of many.  I believe game programming to be a great way of learning any language, since it can force you to think a little more than a simple form-based application.  For this series, I want to create a variation of the traditional Tamagotchi virtual pet, which will allow me to cover a few different topics and programs in the process.  I've playfully named this a "Tom-as3-gotchi," which should be obvious to most (for the rest, consider it a free riddle).
